"WP Biographia is named after the etymology of the modern English word "
"<em>biography</em>. The word first appeared in the 1680s, probably from the "
"latin <em>biographia</em> which itself derived from the Greek <em>bio</em>, "
"meaning \"life\" and <em>graphia</em>, meaning \"record\" or \"account\" "
"which derived from <em>graphein</em>, \"to write\"."
