Add and display a customisable author biography for all single post types, in RSS feeds, in archives and on each entry on the landing page.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to add a customisable biography to posts, to RSS feeds, to pages, to archives and to each post on your blog's landing page. It integrates out of the box with the information that can be provided in each user's profile and supports custom post types. Display of the Biography Box can be suppressed on a global or per user basis for posts, pages and custom post types as well as on a per category basis.

Settings and options include:

1. Choose when to display a Biography Box; on the front page, in archives, on individual posts, pages, or any other custom post type and in RSS feeds.
1. Choose the border style and background color of the Biography Box
1. Choose the amount of user profile information displayed in the Biography Box
1. Choose the avatar image size
1. Choose to display the Biography Box at the top or the bottom of content (universally)
1. Choose to suppress the display of the Biography Box for pages, posts and posts/pages on a per user basis

The plugin expands and enhances the Contact Info section of your user profile, adding support for Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+, Delicious, Flickr, Picasa, Vimeo, YouTube and Reddit profile links as well as Yahoo! Messenger, AIM, Windows Live Messenger and Jabber/Google Talk instant messaging profiles. Your Contact Info links can then be displayed as part of the Biography Box, either as plain text links or as icon links. Further contact links can easily be added to the Biography Box by using the `wp_biographia_contact_info` and `wp_biographia_link_items` filters.

The position of the Biography Box can be controlled by the plugin's supported settings and options, or manually via the plugin's shortcode (`[wp_biographia]`). See the *Shortcode Support And Usage* section for more information.

The position and content of the Biography Box, including adding support for new contact links, changing the content of the Biography Box when displayed via the shortcode, the format of the contact links and the overall format of the Biography Box can be modified by the plugin's filters. See the *Filter Support And Usage* section for more information.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I get help or support for this plugin? =

In short, very easily. But before you read any further, take a look at [Asking For WordPress Plugin Help And Support Without Tears](http://www.vicchi.org/2012/03/31/asking-for-wordpress-plugin-help-and-support-without-tears/) before firing off a question. In order of preference, you can ask a question on the [WordPress support forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/wp-biographia?forum_id=10); this is by far the best way so that other users can follow the conversation. You can ask me a question on Twitter; I'm [@vicchi](http://twitter.com/vicchi). Or you can drop me an email instead. I can't promise to answer your question but I do promise to answer and do my best to help.

= Is there a web site for this plugin? =

Absolutely. Go to the [WP Biographia home page](http://www.vicchi.org/codeage/wp-biographia/) for the latest information. There's also the official [WordPress plugin repository page](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-biographia/) and the [source for the plugin is on GitHub](http://vicchi.github.com/wp-biographia/) as well.

= I've configured WP Biographia to display the author's image but it's not working; what's happening here? =

Author profile pictures, or avatars, are part of the WordPress core but enabling them isn't done at the level of the user profile, instead it's part of the way in which comments are configured. If you enable the display of the post authorâ€™s image, make sure avatar support is turned on; from the Dashboard, navigate to *Settings / Discussion* and ensure that *Show Avatars* is enabled. WordPress uses the email address that is part of your author's profile to look up the right avatar image from [gravatar.com](http://gravatar.com/), so you need to ensure that you're using the same email address on your site as well as for your avatar.

= I want to upload my author's images, host them on my web server and not use Gravatars; how do I do this? =

WP Biographia uses the `get_avatar` [pluggable function](http://codex.wordpress.org/Pluggable_Functions) to output the author's avatar image. Theoretically, any plugin that supports locally hosted avatar images and which overrides the default WordPress implementation of `get_avatar` should be able to be used. In practice, whether this approach will work for you or not depends on the combination of the theme you're using and the interactions that the other plugins that you're using has with the WordPress core and with your theme. The [Simple Local Avatars](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/simple-local-avatars/) plugin plugs `get_avatar` and cooperates nicely with WP Biographia, at least in my local testing environment; your mileage may vary.

= I've configured WP Biographia to show my website/Twitter/Facebook/etc links but I don't see them in the Biography Box; where do I define these links? =

WP Biographia adds a number of social media and web link fields to your WordPress user profile; from the Dashboard, navigate to *Users / Your Profile* and enter the links you want displayed to the fields in the Contact Info section.

= I've installed and configured WP Biographia and now I see not one but two differing Biography Boxes; what's going on? =

There's probably one of two things going on here. Firstly, you've already got another plugin that makes a Biography Box installed and active and this plugin, as well as WP Biographia, are doing their job properly. Secondly, the theme you're using hard codes a Biography Box into the theme templates. Both the TwentyTen and TwentyEleven themes supplied as part of a standard WordPress install do this.

= I only want to show the Biography Box for certain users and not for others; can I do this? =

As of v2.1, WP Biographia allows you to suppress the Biography Box being displayed on a per user basis. You can suppress for posts only, for pages only or for both posts and pages. There's two ways of configuring this. If your user has the `manage_options` capability, you can choose the degree of suppression, if any, from your user profile or for any other user's profile; from the Dashboard, navigate to Users and check the *Suppress From Posts* and/or *Suppress From Pages* checkbox options. You can also configure this easily from the plugin's Settings And Options; from the Dashboard, navigate to the *Settings / WP Biographia* page, click on the *Exclusions* tab and under *User Suppression Settings*, add and/or remove the users to fit your model of who should have the Biography Box displayed.

= I want to show the Biography Box for all users but only for certain categories; can I do this? =

From the Dashboard, navigate to the *Settings / WP Biographia* page, click on the *Exclusions* tab and under *Category Exclusion Settings*, add and/or remove the categories to fit your model of when the Biography Box should be displayed.

= How do I add HTML to the Biographical Info section of a user's profile? =

In previous releases of the plugin, I've recommended that you add this code to your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file:

<code>remove_filter('pre_user_description', 'wp_filter_kses');</code>

But as [WebEndev](http://wordpress.org/support/profile/munman) helpfully pointed out on the [WordPress forums](http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-wp-biographia-biographical-info-formatting-issue-avatar-exclude-posts?replies=7#post-2562773), this allows *all* HTML to be added to the Biography Info section of a user's profile, which may be going *too* far. The following code, in your theme's `functions.php`, will allow line breaks to be honoured but filter out any HTML tags and attributes which are not allowed by the `$allowedposttags` WordPress global.

<code>
remove_filter('pre_user_description', 'wp_filter_kses');
add_filter('pre_user_description', 'wp_filter_post_kses');
add_filter('pre_user_description', 'wptexturize');
add_filter('pre_user_description', 'wpautop');
add_filter('pre_user_description', 'convert_chars');
add_filter('pre_user_description', 'balanceTags', 50);
</code>

This may be a configurable setting in a future version of the plugin to avoid the need to hack your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.

= How do I remove the bio on pages using page templates? =

Add this code to your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file:

<code>add_action ('wp_head', 'remove_author_box_page_template');

function remove_author_box_page_template() {
  if (is_page_template ('page_blog.php'))
		add_filter ('wp_biographia_pattern' , 'content_only_pattern');
}

function content_only_pattern($pattern) {
	return '%1s';
}</code>

This may be a configurable setting in a future version of the plugin to avoid the need to hack your theme's <code>functions.php</code> file.

= I want to use my own icon set for my author's contact links; how do I do this? =

Firstly select the icon set you want to use. You'll need to ensure that the icon files are in `.png` format and are named to match the icon set that WP Biographia ships with; take a look in `wp-biographia/images` to see the naming convention. Upload your icon set to your web server and note the URL (not the local path) to where your icons will live. Navigate to *Settings / WP Biographia* and click on the *Content* tab, ensure that the *Use Alternate Icon Set* option is checked and the URL to your alternate icons is specified in the *Alternate Icon Set URL* text box. By default, WP Biographia sizes the contact link icons at 32x32 pixels; you can override this in your local CSS file by redefining the `.wp-biographia-item-icon` CSS class (see `wp-biographia/css/wp-biographia.css`).

You can also override the icon file name and source URL on a per contact link basis via the `$icon_url_dir` parameter via the `wp_biographia_link_items` filter.

So to recap, the plugin uses its own default set of icons, followed by the *Alternate Icon Set URL* to allow you to point to an entire alternate set of icons, if the supplied ones aren't to your liking, followed by link specific overrides via the `wp_biographia_link_items` filter. The order of precedence looks something like ...

1. the plugin's icon set - for all icons - typically this is `/wp-content/plugins/wp-biographia/images`.
1. the alternate icon set - for all icons (even added via the filter, if no override takes place on `$icon_url_dir`)
1. an override of the icon set URL for the single contact method you're adding via `wp_biographia_link_items` (assuming it's also added via `wp_biographia_contact_info`)

See the *Filter Support And Usage* section for more information on the plugin's filters.

= I want to change the CSS used to format the Biography Box; how do I do this? =

The HTML and CSS classes that the plugin emits follows a consistent structure and naming convention. See [Hacking WP Biographiaâ€™s Appearance With CSS](http://www.vicchi.org/2012/04/05/hacking-wp-biographias-appearance-with-css/) for more information.

= WP Biographia doesn't support social network FOO; can you add this to the next version? =
*Yes*. But also *no*. One of the wonderful things about today's web is the vast amount of ways we have to interact with each other. I can't keep up. No, really. In practical terms, this would mean that the plugin's settings and options panels would soon get out of hand, plus the overhead of adding, testing and releasing a new version of the plugin would get out of hand before the settings and options do. But ... see the next FAQ for the answer.

= WP Biographia doesn't support social network or contact method BAR; how can I add this? =
With the cunning use of the filters that WP Biographia supports, you can add support for as many social networks and/or contact methods as you like. You'll need to do two things for each link you want to add to the plugin.

1. In your theme's `functions.php` add support for the new link to the author's profile by way of the `wp_biographia_contact_info` filter.
1. Still in your theme's `functions.php` add support for the new link to be displayed, with an icon if you wish, via the `wp_biographia_link_items` filter.

See the *Filter Support And Usage* section for a working example of these two filters to add support for a new contact link.

= WP Biographia isn't available in my language; can I submit a translation? =

WordPress and this plugin use the gettext tools to support internationalisation. The source file containing each string that needs to be translated ships with the plugin in `wp-biographia/lang/src/wp-biographia.po`. See the [I18n for WordPress Developers](http://codex.wordpress.org/I18n_for_WordPress_Developers) page for more information or get in touch for help and hand-holding.

= This plugin looks very much like the WP About Author; what's the connection? =

WP Biographia is inspired by and based on the [WP About Author](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-about-author/) plugin by [Jon Bishop](http://www.jonbishop.com/). Thanks and kudos must go to Jon for writing a well structured, working WordPress plugin released under a software license that enables other plugins such as this one to be written or derived in the first place. Jon's written [other WordPress plugins](http://profiles.wordpress.org/users/JonBishop/) as well; you should take a look.

= I want to amend/hack/augment this plugin; can I do the same? =

Totally; like the original plugin by Jon, this plugin is licensed under the GNU General Public License v2 (GPLV2). See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt for the full license terms.

= Where does the name WP Biographia come from? =

WP Biographia is named after the etymology of the modern English word biography. The word first appeared in the 1680s, probably from the latin biographia which itself derived from the Greek bio, meaning "life" and graphia, meaning "record" or "account" which derived from graphein, "to write".

== Shortcode Support And Usage ==

WP Biographia supports a single shortcode, `[wp_biographia]`. Adding this shortcode to the content of a post or page or into a theme template as content, expands the shortcode and replaces it with a Biography Box.

The shortcode also supports multiple *attributes* which allow you to customise the way in which the shortcode is expanded into the Biography Box:

* the `mode` attribute
* the `author` attribute
* the `role` attribute
* the `prefix` attribute
* the `name` attribute

= The "mode" Attribute =

In `raw` mode, which is the default (specified as `[wp_biographia mode="raw"]` or simply as `[wp_biographia]`), the plugin inserts the Biography Box in *you've asked for it, you've got it* mode.

Or to put it another way, the plugin will honour the settings that you specify under *Dashboard / Settings/ WP Biographia* for *Biography Box Style Settings* and for *Biography Box Content Settings* but will ignore the *Biography Box Display Settings* and *Biography Box Per User Settings*.

In `configured` mode, specified as `[wp_biographia mode="configured"]`, the plugin inserts the Biography Box and will honour all the settings under *Dashboard / Settings / WP Biographia* with the exception of *Display On Front Page*, *Display On Individual Post*, *Display On Post Archives* and *Display On Individual Pages*, as well as their equivalents for any custom post types you may have created.

The thinking behind this is that you probably want to honour post or page exclusions and per user exclusions, but by using the shortcode in your theme templates, you want to be in control of how and where the Biography Box is displayed.

= The "author" Attribute =

If the `author` attribute is omitted, which is the default, the shortcode assumes it's being used within the [WordPress Loop](http://codex.wordpress.org/The_Loop) and will display the Biography Box once for the current post's, page's or custom post type's author.

Specifying a user's login name as the `author` attribute overrides this behaviour and allows multi-user sites to use the plugin to create a *contributors* page, where you use the shortcode as `[wp_biographia user="login-name"]` once for each of your site's authors that you want to appear, replacing `"login-name"` with a valid login name for one of your authors.

You call also use the `author` attribute in *wildcard* mode, specifying the author's login name as `*` as `[wp_biographia author="*"]`; this will then loop over all of the authors that have logins on your site, displaying the Biography Box once for each author, ordered alphabetically by login name.

Specifying an invalid login name (`[wp_biographia author="idontexist"]`) will result in no Biography Box being displayed. Specifying an empty login name (`[wp_biographia author=""]`) will cause the `author` parameter to be ignored and may result in undefined behaviour, such as a partially populated Biography Box being displayed as the shortcode is being used outside of the Loop and thus no author information is made available to the plugin by WordPress.

= the "role" Attribute =

Valid only when used in conjunction with the `author` attribute in *wildcard* mode, the `role` attribute allows you to filter the authors that have user accounts on your blog according to their [WordPress Role](http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities). The `role` attribute takes a single argument which defines the WordPress role; at the time of writing, this can be one of:

* `administrator`
* `editor`
* `author`
* `contributor`
* `subscriber`

For example, if you want to display the Biography Box for all users of your blog who have a role of `author` you can use the `role` attribute plus the `author` attribute in *wildcard* mode to do this, along the lines of `[wp_biographia user="*" role="author"]`.

Specifying an invalid role (`[wp_biographia user="*" role="foo"])` will result in no Biography Box being displayed. Specifying the `role` attribute without the `author` attribute in *wildcard* mode will have no effect.

= The "prefix" Attribute =

If the `prefix` attribute is omitted, which is the default, the Biography Box will be displayed with *Biography Prefix* text configured in *Settings/ WP Biographuia / Biography Box Content Settings* before the author's name. This can be overridden by using the `prefix` attribute, along the lines of `[wp_biographia prefix="All About"]`.

= The "name" Attribute =

If the `name` attribute is omitted, which is the default, the Biography Box will be displayed with the author's name as configured by *Author's Name* in *Settings / WP Biographia /Biography Box Content Settings*. This can be overriden by supplying one of the following for the `name` attribute's argument:

* `account-name`
* `first-last-name`
* `nickname`
* `display-name`
* `none`

== Filter Support And Usage ==

WP Biographia supports multiple filters, which are described in more detail below. The plugin's filters allow you to:

* change the default set of installation settings and options at plugin activation time
* modify and/or enhance the set of contact information fields the plugin adds to the author's profile
* modify and/or enhance the contact links that are added to the Biography Box by the plugin
* modify the position of the Biography Box to before or after the post content returned by `the_content()` and/or `the_excerpt()`
* suppress the display of the Biography Box entirely under user-defined circumstances
* modify and/or enhance the Biography Box that is produced by the `[wp_biographia]` shortcode
* modify and/or enhance the format and content of the contact links that are added to the Biography Box by the plugin
* modify and/or enhance the Biography Box that is produced for an RSS feed
* modify and/or enhance the entirety of the Biography Box

= wp_biographia_default_settings =

Applied to the default set of plugin settings and options. Note that this filter is called once, upon plugin activation, when there are no WP Biographia settings/options existing in the database.

*Example:* Add the date and time that the plugin was first activated

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_default_settings', 'add_activation_timestamp');

function add_activation_timestamp ($options) {
	// options = array (option name => option value)
	$options['plugin_activation_timestamp'] = date (DATE_ATOM);
	
	return $options;
}`

= wp_biographia_contact_info =

Applied to the default set of contact information fields that are added to an author's profile by the plugin. Note that in order to add and display a new contact link to the Biography Box, the contact link must be added to the value returned by the `wp_biographia_link_items` filter as well as the value returned by this filter.

*Example:* Add Pinterest as a supported contact information field

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_contact_info', 'add_pinterest_support');

function add_pinterest_support ($contacts) {
	// contacts = array (field => array (field => field-name, contactmethod => description))
	$contacts['pinterest'] = array (
		'field' => 'pinterest',
		'contactmethod' => __('Pinterest')
	);
	
	return $contacts;
}`

= wp_biographia_link_items =

Applied to the default set of contact links that are added to the Biography Box by the plugin. Note that in order to add and display a new contact link, the contact information field must be added to the value returned by the `wp_biographia_contact_info` filter as well as the value returned by this filter. Note that `$icon_dir_url` will by default contain the URL of the images directory within the plugin directory, which will look something like `/wp-content/plugins/wp-biographia/images/` (the trailing slash is important). If an alternate icon directory has been specified in the plugin's settings and options, then `$icon_dir_url` will contain this alternate, configured, directory URL. If the icon you want to add for a new contact link doesn't reside in the directory URL mentioned previously, you'll need to set `$icon_dir_url` to point to your own custom location.

*Example:* Add Pinterest as a supported contact link in the Biography Box

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_link_items', 'add_pinterest_link', 2);

function add_pinterest_link ($links, $icon_dir_url) {
	// links = array (field => array (link_title => title, link_text => text, link_icon => URL)
	$links['pinterest'] = array (
		'link_title' => __('Pinterest'),
		'link_text' => __('Pinterest'),
		'link_icon' => $icon_dir_url . 'pinterest.png'
		);

		return $links;
}`

= wp_biographia_pattern =

Applied to the format string used to position the Biography Box before the post content or after the post content that is returned by `the_content()` and/or `the_excerpt()`.

*Example:* Insert a header between post content and Biography Box

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_pattern', 'insert_biography_header');

function insert_biography_header ($pattern) {
	return '%1$s<p class="biography-header">About The Author</p>%2$s';
}`

= wp_biographia_pre =

Allows display of the Biography Box to be suppressed under user-defined circumstances. This only affects the display of the Biography Box that is configured via the plugin's admin screen or via the shortcode in configured mode.

*Example:* Suppress the Biography Box

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_pre', 'suppress_biography_box');

function suppress_biography_box ($flag) {

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_links', 'add_shortcode_css', 10, 2);

function add_shortcode_css ($content, $params) {
	// params = array (mode => shortcode-mode, author => author-id, prefix => prefix-string,
						name => name-option)

	return '<div class="custom-shortcode-css">' . $content . '</div>';
}`

= wp_biographia_links =

Applied to the formatted set of contact links for the current instance of the Biography Box.

*Example:* Replace the default text link separator character (the pipe symbol "|") with a dash ("-").

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_links', 'replace_link_separator', 10, 3);

function replace_link_separator ($content, $links, $params) {
	// links = array (link-item)
	// params = array (glue => separator-string, class => link-item-css-class-name,
	//					prefix => links-prefix-html, postfix => links-postfix-html)
	
	return str_replace ($params['glue'], ' - ', $content);
}`

*Example:* Wrap the formatted content links in an additional HTML div.

`add_filter ('wp_biographia_links', 'wrap_links', 10, 3);

function wrap_links ($content, $links, $params) {
	// links = array (link-item)
	// params = array (glue => separator-string, class => link-item-css-class-name,
	//					prefix => links-prefix-html, postfix => links-postfix-html)
	
	$new_prefix = '<div class="custom-link-class">' . $params['prefix'];
	$new_postfix = $params['postfix'] . '</div>';
	
	return $new_prefix . implode ($params['glue'], $links) . $new_postfix;

function replace_css_classes ($biography, $items) {
	$new_content = array ();
